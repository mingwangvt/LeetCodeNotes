\#401 Binary Watch
- Bit manipulation:  
Bitwise operators:
  - **NOT(~)**  
Bitwise NOT is an unary operator that flips the bits of the number i.e., if the ith bit is 0, it will change it to 1 and vice versa.
0变1,1变0

  - **AND(&)**
Bitwise AND is a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 1, otherwise 0.
都是1结果为1，否则为0

  - **OR（|）**
 Bitwise OR is also a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns, similar to bitwise AND. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.
都是0为0，否则为1

  - **XOR（^）**
Bitwise XOR also takes two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0 or 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.
都是0或1才是0，否则是1

  - **Left shift(<<)**
Left shift operator is a binary operator which shift the some number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the left and append 0 at the end. Left shift is equivalent to multiplying the bit pattern with  ( if we are shifting k bits ).
1 << 1 = 2 = 2<sup>1</sup>
1 << 2 = 4 = 2<sup>2</sup>
1 << 3 = 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>
1 << 4 = 16 = 2<sup>4</sup>
…
1 << n = 2<sup>n</sup>
相当于在1的后面加n个0；

  - **Right shift**
  Right shift operator is a binary operator which shift the some number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the right and append 1 at the end. Right shift is equivalent to dividing the bit pattern with 2<sup>k</sup> ( if we are shifting k bits ).
  4 >> 1 = 2
  6 >> 1 = 3
  5 >> 1 = 2
  16 >> 4 = 1

- Example of bit manipulation
  - 判断N是不是power of 2.
如果N是power of 2的话，binary representation of N应该是只有1个1,1的右边都为0.而N-1应该是除了最左边的1变为0，右边都为1（进位前）
N = 4 = (100)<sub>2</sub>
N - 1 = 3 = (011)<sub>2</sub>
N & (N-1) = (100)<sub>2</sub> & (011)<sub>2</sub> = (000)<sub>2</sub>
